I have been on every continent on this amazing planet. I have visited and photographed dozens of interesting cultures, spectacular landscapes and abundant wildlife. So I will venture out on a limb and say this... mile for mile, there is no place else on Earth that is as densely rich for photographers as is the Canadian Rockies. 

Winter or summer, spring or fall, as a photographer I am faced with new photo opps around every curve in the road. Hiking and cresting a mountain trail I marvel at the glacial lakes and scenics that confront me. 

In this gallery, I present just a smattering of images that vainly try to capture some of that majesty. I do hope you enjoy them.
