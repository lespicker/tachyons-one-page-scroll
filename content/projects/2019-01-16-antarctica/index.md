How can one describe the indescribable? I stood in the midst of a colony of one million penguins, photographing their antics, when I found my camera drifting away from my eye. I realized how futile my images would be in capturing the shear abundance of what lay before me. And how about the sounds of one million birds squawking at each other? Or the pungent smell of guano as deep as my ankles?

Antarctica is shear magnificence. Air purer and crisper than anywhere else on Earth. Seemingly limitless oceans. Icebergs the size of small towns. Mountains rising from the ocean, disgorging its towering white glaciers back to the sea. Penguins, pelagic birds, seals and whales feeding, breeding, rearing their young, immersed in the frantic cycle of life.  

Penguins glide through the icy waters feeding on krill. Leopard seals stealthily hunt the penguins. Orcas hunt the seals. I feel intense gratitude that people came to their senses here and stopped the wanton slaughter of animals in the Antarctic and the destruction of the once pristine landscapes. Give nature a chance and the results speak for themselves. Abundance is the cautious whisper here. 

I will be leading a photo trip to the Antarctic in 2020-2021 (December-January). If you are interested in joining me, please sign up on this website for updates.
