Over the years as a fine art print workshop leader, I've been asked countless times how one goes about translating those beautiful prints you have created into a gallery show or public exhibition. In fact, several of our clients who have taken our [print and our portfolio workshops](https://lesterpickerphoto.com/types/workshop/) have gone on to land exciting photo exhibitions. 

I have now packaged my knowledge of how to land and pull off a very successful gallery show into a 60-page, fully illustrated book. This how-to guide will explain the various types of exhibitions and walk you through how to prepare for them, how to approach gallery owners or venue managers, negotiating your contract, how to set up, staging your critical Opening Night, how you should follow up, and much more. I've targeted this eBook to both first-time exhibitors and experienced ones who wish to improve their exhibitions.
