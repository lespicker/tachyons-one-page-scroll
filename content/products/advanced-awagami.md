## Introduction

Awagami Japanese washi inkjet papers are a specialized medium for producing fine art digital prints. The range runs from subtle matte papers through highly textured dramatic papers. The papers also run the gamut from ultra-thin to extremely thick. The key to utilizing these unique and beautiful materials is matching the paper to a photograph and artistic vision that work in harmony.

This day and a half hands-on workshop will result in two completed, mounted, ready to display, artworks on Awagami paper that best represents your artistic intention. More importantly the experience with the selection, discernment, and realization of your art will be invaluable as you move forward using Awagami materials for future projects. Interaction with your attending colleagues will further enrich your experience.

> The Awagami workshop was exceptional. It provided practical information emphasizing the need for creativity rather than paint-by-numbers instructions. The workshop helped me understand the characteristics of the wide range, the differences among the papers, and useful suggestions as to what types of images will work best, and – equally important – which won’t. I went into the workshop doubtful whether Awagami washi papers would provide results worth the effort. I emerged convinced.<cite>Bill Iverson</cite>

## True Individualized Attention

Two to four weeks prior to the workshop we ask that each participant prepare a selection of 10 to 20 images and share them with us. We will review each image and arrange a one-on-one conversation to collaborate on our recommendations for final image selection (and a few alternates). This preparation is important so that we understand your work, your vision, and can provide personalized guidance that will result in realizing your art.

We strictly limit attendance to four photographers so that we can focus on each one's work and provide a relaxed environment with plenty of time to achieve your artistic goals.
