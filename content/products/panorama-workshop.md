In this all day workshop (9AM - 5PM) you will learn how to take exceptional, art print quality panorama images. You will receive complete instruction, from understanding parallax and measuring nodal points to the post-processing and display of pano images. 

Today it is easier than ever to take panoramic images with an iPhone, point-and-shoot camera, or even a hand-held DSLR. But, to obtain truly professional panoramas that you are able to enlarge into sharp, detailed prints or room-sized wallpaper installations (see video below) you have to use good equipment and flawless technique. In this workshop you will go a few steps further, with Les' tips, suggestions and his personal workflow that will result in the highest level of artistic expression. 

Les' panoramas have been printed for collectors on large-format fine art papers in sizes up to six-feet long. Les' panoramas have also been enlarged into wallpapers that are as large as 30-feet by 10-feet and are exhibited in hospitals and offices. All Les' work is produced in his studio, where the workshop will be held, with outdoor field work included.  

As with all Les' workshops, students are invited to ask Les questions or for his photographic advice well after the workshop ends. More than 75% of Les' clients have attended one of Les' lectures or have taken a workshop with him before, reflecting his commitment to his clients and his craft. For a list of Les' other workshops, please [click here](https://lesterpickerphoto.com/types/workshop/). 

The majority of the day will be spent in determining the nodal point for your favorite lens that you use for panoramas, followed by an outside excursion to actually shoot panoramas using Really Right Stuff pano equipment. We will then bring those images back to the studio for post processing. While this is not a fine art printing workshop, you are invited to take Les' print workshop where you will be able to print your panorama on our large format Canon printers. Alternately, we can do the printing for you and securely mail the print to you, all at additional charge. 

**This workshop is limited to four photographers to allow for individualized attention.**
