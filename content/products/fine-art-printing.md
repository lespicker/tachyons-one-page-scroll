> This was the perfect workshop for me. It allowed me to separate the theory from the practice and understand the practice of fine art printing with one-on-one guidance from the master artist, Les Picker, and master printer Bob Boyer.<cite>Gary Schubert, Pennsylvania</cite>

**For people taking this printing workshop who wish to add the Framing workshop on Sunday March 20, the cost for that workshop will be $450. For technical reasons, please sign up and pay the $500 fee and $50 will be refunded to your account.**

Are you ready to move your photo images from hiding in the dark recesses of your hard drive? Have you always wanted to share your best images with others? Would you like to decorate the walls of your home with your best photographic work? If the answer to any of these questions is ‘Yes’ then you should definitely register for our Basic Printing Workshop.

If you are like most digital photographers today, you have carefully honed your craft and have taken numerous awe-inspiring images. Now you are ready to display them on the finest photo papers for guests to see, to give as gifts, or to sell to those who appreciate your artistic efforts.

By the end of our one-day workshop, held in historic Havre de Grace, Maryland, you will not only learn a basic, color-managed workflow that is consistent and repeatable for fine art quality results, but you will leave the workshop with an unlimited number of large-format prints on fine art, museum-quality archival papers.

And unlike virtually all printing workshops you will see advertised, we never accept more than six people, so you are assured of individual attention in a learning environment second to none.

> I have been wanting to thank you again for your wonderful printing workshop.  You have no idea how frustrated I was, trying to prepare my prints for my first art show. I was literally at a stand-still. I had done everything except **PRINT my images!!!** I can’t thank you enough for getting me over that hurdle and helping me to move forward with what I love to do.<br><br>My booth came together just how I envisioned it would, and I had so many wonderful comments about my prints.  I actually sold way more than I expected!<br><br>Thanks to your expertise and help, my fine art photography business is moving forward and I’m loving printing my own work.<cite> Pam Phillips, Pennsylvania</cite>

### Our Learning Environment
Our studio in Havre de Grace, Maryland has been designed from the ground up to accommodate intimate groups of passionate photographers willing to expand their skills. We constructed our space from bare walls to enable us to produce the finest photographic prints imaginable.

We use a Canon Pro4000 large format printer for prints up to 44”, as well as three additional large format professional Canon printers for prints up to 24” (Don't worry, the concepts you learn will apply to whatever printers you choose).

Our in-studio kitchenette has fresh coffee, teas and drinks and refreshments always available to keep you energized. We use all-Apple computer equipment, but Bob is well versed in PC technology as well. In our workshops we focus on Lightroom for post-processing and printing.

Our historic town of Havre de Grace is fortunate to have excellent lodging choices, great restaurants and lots of photographic opportunities. We will provide you with a list of these possibilities when you register.

> Les and Bob did a good job stepping us through the printing process.  This is a good workshop for those that are not familiar with printing and color management.  I particularly liked Bob’s thoughts on post processing some images in prep for printing.   Very common sense approach.
