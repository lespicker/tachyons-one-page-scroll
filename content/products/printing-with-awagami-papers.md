### Printing With Awagami Inkjet Papers

> Like the coffee cake, I was left craving more… I have already started to make up a final shopping list. Please put me at the top of the list for your next Washi/Awagami workshop. I’m in! <cite>Chris Jewett</cite>

Awagami inkjet papers for producing fine art prints are unique among the plethora of papers available. No other papers have the same feel, look, or special *”image in the paper”* as opposed to on top of the paper rendition. These are truly special materials that can elevate your fine art prints to another whole new level.

Awagami’s selection of papers is huge ranging from extremely thin, parchment-like material to ultra-thick, extremely textured handmade sheets that are works of art in themselves. They also range in base tone from completely neutral to very warm. Faced with all of the options offered in the Awagami paper range it can be daunting to decide where to start and what papers will match your artistic vision. 

We’ve spent the last three years exploring and understanding the unique properties of these beautiful materials. This workshop will serve to provide a framework for understanding the entire range of these beautiful papers, provide hands-on experience with them and their properties, and most importantly provide insight into the secret of pairing your images to the right paper to achieve your vision.

## Image/Paper Pairing

Choosing the right paper for your images and your vision is always important, using Awagami papers takes this critical step far beyond “glossy or matte”. This full-day workshop will provide the opportunity with expert guidance to match the right material to your images and see them as final prints.

- Pre-workshop assessment of images you will bring to the workshop with recommendations
- Pre-workshop discussion to understand your artistic vision
- A framework to approach Awagami’s large inventory of materials and where to start
- Fine-tuning a look based on your vision
- Proofing
- Production of final prints you will take home with you

The workshop is strictly limited to four participants in each session for one-on-one attention and small group collaboration and feedback. We’ll walk through paper selection, proofing, and final printing with each participant to get to those final prints on large-sized Awgami paper that best suits your image and vision.

After this workshop you will feel comfortable and confident in choosing the best options within the Awagami range of fine art papers without random, expensive, trial and error.

*Les Picker is the first fine art photographer in the world named as an official Awagami Ambassador. In this introductory workshop you will enter the exciting world of washi hand-made papers from the 8th generation Awagami craftspeople. Awagami offers a wide range of papers made specifically for digital printing.*

> The Introduction to Awagami workshop was inspiring and informative. The unique, hand made, process of making the paper is fascinating. I’m searching for that “special” image that merits printing on such exquisite paper!<cite>Carolyn Mead</cite>
