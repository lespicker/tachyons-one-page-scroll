Sixteen Photographers distinguished in their fields professionally and as educators. Each brings extensive experience in communicating their photographic knowledge and wisdom. The Summit's structure and casual atmosphere provides ample opportunities to engage these photographers one-on-one (many of whom are available for portfolio reviews: see horizon registration page for details).

Five intensive hands-on workshops with some of the exceptional Summit photographers give you the opportunity to learn in an intimate setting from the masters. Small groups sizes insure each attendee receives individual attention. We encourage you to sign up ASAP as spaces are limited and workshops often fill up quickly.

Twenty-eight inspiring and informative presentations from seasoned professionals cover a wide gamut of photographic disciplines (journalism, portraiture, architecture, landscape, fashion, food, product, comedy, nature, wildlife, pet, etc.) and techniques (studio and location lighting, digital editing and plugins, infrared and night photography, time-lapse and in-camera effects, etc.) Photographers present original work and explain their processes and techniques, share stories about their own professional development and even provide insider tips and secrets from their specific fields.
