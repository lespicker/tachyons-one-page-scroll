Set your photography apart from chaotic instant gratification of Instagram likes. Raise your photographic presentations to new heights. Create gifts valued by generations to follow. *Welcome to the world of hand-made photography books!* 

In this 3-1/2 day workshop you will learn the skills needed to  create your own one-of-a-kind photography books, from cutting and wrapping your own covers to assembling your images on Moab fine art papers and binding them into a beautiful, hand-stitched work of art. A hand-crafted book is arguably the epitome of a photographic legacy, an heirloom for families for generations. With the skills you will learn, you will be able to craft other books at your leisure. 

This intensive, very hands-on workshop is taught by Lester Picker, whose work is found in the permanent collections of photography museums and private homes. Always enamored with ancient hand-made books during his tours of museums as a child, Les has devoted the past few years immersed in this historic art form.

Les has earned several awards for his teaching, and in this workshop you will learn the ins and outs of bookmaking, skills you can carry forward in your work. You will leave this workshop with a hand-crafted, beautifully presented photography book and with knowing how to:

- cull, sequence and self-edit your images
- accurately measure paper, book covers, inside book covers, slip case and more
- measure and cut your pages to size
- final trim your pages
- adhere fabric to the cover stock and adhere the inside book cover
- drill holes in your pages and covers to prepare them for hand stitching
- create basic bookbinding stitch
- hand stitch your book
- measure, cut, cover and assemble a tasteful slipcase to hold your book

A critical component of this workshop is to also gain experience in the difficult art of culling, sequencing and self-editing your work. 

For this workshop you will be required to submit thirty image files in advance and receive feedback and guidance from Les and Bob Boyer, his longtime Associate. Once the images are finalized to 12 images, Bob, a master printer, will print them on the appropriate Moab fine art paper. 

When you arrive in Les' studio, you will be ready to start the hands-on portion of this unique experience.
