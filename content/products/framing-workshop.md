**Starting at 8:15AM Saturday July 19th and ending 5:00PM Sunday July 20th**

In this two day hands-on workshop participants will be introduced to a variety of framing options, with tips on which are best suited for various types of photography. Participants will take home finished framed products that they have made themselves.

Participants will:
- create their own displays on Gatorboard;
- put together a traditional frame with glazing, mats, backing boards, dust covers, hangers and all else needed for a classic display;
- create an open-frame display.

> After spending time printing images that I would like to hang on my wall (as well as the walls of friends, family, and perhaps others), Les’s framing workshop gave me valuable insight into some of the various techniques one can use to display images.  Covering everything from the cost-effective utilization of Gatorboard to display images, to the soup-to-nuts construction of a traditional frame — including frame construction from framing sticks (I may still have sawdust in my shoes from cutting our own wood frames), mat cutting, glazing, etc. — Les’s framing workshop was a superb and completely hands-on introduction to the world of image display.  Simply put: bravo! <cite>Greg Stuhlman</cite>

The workshop will include demonstrations and hands-on work making your own frames under Les’ supervision. You will leave the workshop with at least one example of each of the three framing approaches. 

Prints to be mounted will be supplied by Les, but participants are encouraged to submit their own photos in advance that we will print on fine art paper. All prints for the workshop will be on 13 x 19" paper (including borders). 

All framing materials are included as is use of all tools needed for construction. No prior knowledge of tools is required. Due to its hand-on nature, the Framing workshop is restricted to three participants. 

Les has been framing his Limited Edition prints for decades and will share his techniques, tips, resources and guidance throughout the workshop experience.
