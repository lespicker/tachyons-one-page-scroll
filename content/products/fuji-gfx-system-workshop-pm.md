I'm excited to host a **FREE** 3 hour workshop focused on getting some hands-on experience with the Fujifilm GFX system, a camera and lens line-up I've grown to love over the last few years. There will be two sessions on July 31, 2021. This one is 1PM until 4PM. [The other will be 9AM until 12PM](/products/fuji-gfx-system-workshop-am/). Please register for your prefered time.

Fujifilm USA will be on-site for two workshops in the LPFA studio introducing attendees to the Fujifilm GFX line of medium format cameras and lenses. Both sessions are equivalent, offering convenient morning and afternoon options of 3-hours each. Each session is limited to 8 people in order to give participants hands-on access to all equipment. Aside from the GFX 50S, 50R, 100, and 100S, all Fujinon GF lenses will be available to try. Les will have indoor macro setups available and participants may wander outside to shoot. 

In 2018 Les made the switch from full-frame DSLR to exclusively shooting the Fujifilm GFX system and both he, his Associate, and Fujifilm USA will be available to assist participants and answer questions. Participants will experience the amazing resolution of Fujinon lenses and the GFX 100's ability to not only produce its normal 102 MP files but - are you ready for this? - 400MP files! 

The event will take place on Saturday, July 31 at the LPFA studio in Havre de Grace, Maryland. Upon registration, participants will be sent a detailed letter with the address, items they may want to bring and other details.
