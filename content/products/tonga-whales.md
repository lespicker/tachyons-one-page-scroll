This is a trip you really don’t want to miss! Spend 4 solid days of snorkeling in the waters of Vava’u, Tonga amongst southern humpback whales and their offspring. Imagine snorkeling up to a 40-ton gentle giant, in a peaceful setting, and spending time watching and observing with a small underwater camera or GoPro. Come and join Andy  and Les in the calm waters of Tonga and find out for yourself.

You will need to be reasonably fit in order to fully enjoy this trip. You don’t need to have any snorkeling experience, however you need to feel comfortable swimming without any assistance in open waters. We will spend our time going from the dock to our boat and into the ocean; humpback whale experiences are real and they are safe. Some of the whale sightings will happen from our boat and some will happen when you are snorkeling in the ocean.

The Kingdom of Tonga is made up of 170 tropical islands and most are uninhabited. Tonga has white sand beaches, calm seas and wonderful temperatures at this time of the year. We have chosen accommodations that will give us the best access to the locations, minimize long driving times and allow us to relax at the end of each day, after the sun sets and the cameras are put away. This is a vacation, after all.

Non-photographing spouses are welcome and can participate in all activities. 

## Trip Highlights At A Glance

Extra batteries and accessories such as selfie sticks will be provided as well. Hands-on instruction on how to use GoPro cameras for video and stills, as well as instruction on how to use the more popular video editing software on the market. We will work with you to make sure your photo and video needs are met.

Real close-up adventures with humpback whales is an experience of a lifetime. Don’t worry about a thing. We have everything taken care of! All you need to do is arrive and we will take care of the rest.

## The Schedule

### Monday, September 28, 2020:  Tongan Beach Resort, Vava’u

With over 170 islands full of wonder, unspoiled beauty, lined with white beaches and coral reefs, the Kingdom of Tonga is an unforgettable destination.

On arrival to Vava’u, you will be greeted and transferred to Mango café for lunch overlooking the harbor. Following lunch, we will transfer to our accommodation to check in. Our accommodations for the next 5 nights is set on 500 feet of beachfront with all 12 guest rooms enjoying views of the golden sand beach and crystal clear turquoise waters of the Port of Refuge Harbor.

Enjoy time at leisure this afternoon before reconvening for a whale swim briefing. We will have time to be fitted with snorkeling gear and dip in the water to get used to our equipment as well as familiarize ourselves with the guidelines for getting out of the boat and protocols regarding swimming with the whales. Enjoy a welcome dinner in house this evening. 

### Tuesday, September 29 – Friday, October 2: Tongan Beach Resort, Vava’u

Over the next four days partake in an experience of a lifetime by swimming up close and personal with Humpback Whales. Before departing the resort, each guest will be fitted with their snorkeling gear and provided with a personalized bag to put their equipment in for the next four days. 

Vacationers are not the only ones to return to Tonga’s shores on a regular basis. After a long journey north from the icy krill-laden depths of Antarctica, southern humpback whales take shelter in the tropical reef-protected waters of Tonga to give birth to their young. 

The arrival of the whales from June to November completes a remarkable cycle, as the new calves return to where they were first conceived 11 months earlier. Tonga is one of the few places in the world where you can swim with whales. You may get to hear the beautiful singing, see the stunning full body breaching, watch as a group of males peruse a female mate or see a mother gently tending to her calf. 

Each day can be quite different, as our opportunities are solely dictated by the whales’ activity and presence. Swimming excursions will be monitored by our guides with the well-being and safety of both the whales and participants as a top priority. Each swim can last anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes at a time, depending on conditions and the comfort level of the whales. If the animals seem stressed or disturbed by our presence, the guides reserve the right to conclude the experience at any time. This process will be repeated throughout the day. Only 4 people will be allowed in the water at a time, allowing for intimate experiences and to not stress the animals. This also allows for resting in between swims. 

The Vava'u Archipelago is blessed with a near-perfect climate. In conjunction with swimming with the whales, you also have the opportunity to snorkel in the amazing crystal clear water with its brilliantly colored coral and reef fish. Snorkel the Blue Clouds Reef and Coral Garden.

On one of our nights we will transfer via boat to a local restaurant in town for dinner.

### Saturday, October 3: Depart Vava’u

Depending on your departure time you may spend time independently sightseeing, shopping or relaxing in this lovely marine city before transferring to the airport for flights home, re-crossing the international date line and regaining the day we lost flying westbound.
