This is a trip you really don’t want to miss! Spend 4 solid days of snorkeling in the waters of Vava’u, Tonga amongst southern humpback whales and their offspring. Imagine snorkeling up to a 40-ton gentle giant, in a peaceful setting, and spending time watching and observing with a small underwater camera or GoPro. Come and join Andy  and Les in the calm waters of Tonga and find out for yourself.

You will need to be reasonably fit in order to fully enjoy this trip. You don’t need to have any snorkeling experience, however you need to feel comfortable swimming without any assistance in open waters. We will spend our time going from the dock to our boat and into the ocean; humpback whale experiences are real and they are safe. Some of the whale sightings will happen from our boat and some will happen when you are snorkeling in the ocean.

The Kingdom of Tonga is made up of 170 tropical islands and most are uninhabited. Tonga has white sand beaches, calm seas and wonderful temperatures at this time of the year. We have chosen accommodations that will give us the best access to the locations, minimize long driving times and allow us to relax at the end of each day, after the sun sets and the cameras are put away. This is a vacation, after all.

Non-photographing spouses are welcome and can participate in all activities. 

## Trip Highlights At A Glance

Extra batteries and accessories such as selfie sticks will be provided as well. Hands-on instruction on how to use GoPro cameras for video and stills, as well as instruction on how to use the more popular video editing software on the market. We will work with you to make sure your photo and video needs are met.
