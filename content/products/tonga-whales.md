This is a trip you really don’t want to miss! Spend 7 glorious days in sunny Tonga, with 4 solid days of snorkeling amongst southern humpback whales and their just born calves. Join Les in the calm, clear blue waters of Tonga and find out for yourself.

You will need to be reasonably fit in order to fully enjoy this trip. You don’t need any snorkeling experience. However you should feel comfortable snorkeling without any assistance in open waters, under the watchful eyes of our guides. Humpback whale experiences are amazing and safe. Inexpensive waterproof cameras will enable even a beginner to capture incredible still and video memories. 

The Kingdom of Tonga is made up of 170 tropical islands with white sand beaches, calm seas and delightful temperatures. We have chosen accommodations that will give us the best access to the locations, minimize long driving times and allow us to relax at the end of each day, after the sun sets and the cameras are put away. Non-photographing spouses are welcome and can participate in all activities. 

From Tonga we fly to Fiji and then on to the South Island of New Zealand for two weeks of superb photography. Our private bus will take us to spectacular landscapes, quaint towns and iconic places in the very best light. 

At the conclusion of the main trip, we will offer a 5-day extension to New Zealand's North Island. Details available on request.
