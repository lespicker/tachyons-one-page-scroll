Discover the wild side of photography through the stories and images of wildlife across the world taken by a pro wildlife photographer. In this workshop, [Sean Lo (www.seanlophotography.com)](http://www.seanlophotography.com) will address what makes a compelling wildlife photo. Is it the subjects? The composition? The background? In this 6-hour workshop we will take a look at major wildlife photographers and the photographic choices they make, how one goes about making them, and how they ultimately create the impact and drama for their audience to see. We will also explore how to achieve our personal wildlife photography potential from the gear we use and our photographic style, to the creative post-editing choices we make to breathe life into our work.

> There is so much to discover about ourselves through wildlife. Once I learned the power of photography, I realized that my intent was not just to translate my overwhelmed senses, but to create stories of wildlife that have impact. Knowing this gives me purpose.<cite>Sean Lo</cite>
