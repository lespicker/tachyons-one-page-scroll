> Before beginning my  career as a full time professional wildlife photographer, I spent a great deal of time training by photographing animals which were most accessible to me. My local zoos became places of photographic learning, research, and inspiration for "real" wildlife photography. But evewn my training period was not wasted. My Snow Leopard photo taken at a zoo was published on National Geographic.<cite>Sean Lo</cite>

Fast forward years ahead and Sean worked as the exclusive wildlife photographer at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, MD photographing both off site in the wild and also on site. 

In this workshop, Sean will address the challenges of photographing in zoos, animal parks and aquaria, how to overcome them, and how to develop pictures that mimic natural environments.
