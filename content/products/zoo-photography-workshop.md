All of these exciting wildlife photographs were made at the zoo.  In this hands-on workshop Sean Lo will share his secrets of making compelling wildlife images in the most unlikely of environments. This workshop includes discussions as well as opportunities to make your own images. The day will kick off with an interactive classroom session at the Les Picker Fine Art Photography studio in Havre de Grace, Maryland. The rest of the day will be spent at the Baltimore Zoo putting earlier discussions into action with the expert one-on-one assistance of Sean. Detailed information and directions to the studio will be sent upon registration.

> Before beginning my career as a full time professional wildlife photographer, I spent a great deal of time training by photographing animals which were most accessible to me. My local zoos became places of photographic learning, research, and inspiration for "real" wildlife photography. But even my training period was not wasted. My Snow Leopard photo taken at a zoo was published on National Geographic.<cite>Sean Lo</cite>

Fast forward years ahead and Sean worked as the exclusive wildlife photographer at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, MD photographing both off site in the wild and also on site. 

In this workshop, [Sean (www.seanlophotography.com)](http://www.seanlophotography.com) will address the challenges of photographing in zoos, animal parks and aquaria, how to overcome them, and how to develop pictures that mimic natural environments.
