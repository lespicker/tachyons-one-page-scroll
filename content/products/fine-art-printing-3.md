> This was the perfect workshop for me. It allowed me to separate the theory from the practice and understand the practice of fine art printing with one-on-one guidance from the master artist, Les Picker, and master printer Bob Boyer.<cite>Gary Schubert, Pennsylvania</cite>

This workshop is designed for all photographers who want to realize their artistic vision in print. No matter if you are just starting out with making digital prints or have experience, we believe this workshop will give you skills and insight into the print-making process that will elevate your photographic prints. 

We have been hosting this unique one-day workshop for more than a decade tailoring it to the needs of todays photographic artists. Our curriculum covers all technical aspects of fine art print making using Adobe Lightroom. More importantly it does so in a hands-on process as we work with each participant's own photographs and vision. Every print is proofed on-screen, discussed in terms of your vision, and brought to a final large format print in a collegial setting. 

Our stress on process, the ability to articulate your vision, receive productive feedback, and incorporate that into your final print, while guiding you in technical aspects of post processing and printing, will uniquely prepare you to confidently  evaluate your photographs and proofs that will lead you to realize your vision in final prints.

Join us in celebrating and elevating the art of photography in its best medium &mdash; the fine art print. We strictly limit participation in this workshop to four photographers so that we can give each person the one-on-one attention that is specific to your needs and artistic vision.


> I have been wanting to thank you again for your wonderful printing workshop.  You have no idea how frustrated I was, trying to prepare my prints for my first art show. I was literally at a stand-still. I had done everything except **PRINT my images!!!** I can’t thank you enough for getting me over that hurdle and helping me to move forward with what I love to do.<br><br>My booth came together just how I envisioned it would, and I had so many wonderful comments about my prints.  I actually sold way more than I expected!<br><br>Thanks to your expertise and help, my fine art photography business is moving forward and I’m loving printing my own work.<cite> Pam Phillips, Pennsylvania</cite>
