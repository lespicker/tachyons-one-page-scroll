I know, I know. What is bonsai and why on Earth would anyone want to photograph it? The answer to the first question is that bonsai is the Japanese art of miniature trees, which originated with the Chinese art of Penjing a couple of thousand years ago. 

The answer to the second question is that I am into bonsai but have so far not tried to photograph them seriously. So, I figure if I'm interested in this event, there must be one or two of you out there who just might also be interested. Then again, maybe not and I'll just go alone.
