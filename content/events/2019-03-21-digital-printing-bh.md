In this presentation I cover a wide range of topics from why bother to print in today's age, a practical explanation of color management, and how to achieve the best results on today's  printers. I showcase sample mounted prints, both B&W and color and discuss how they were made, from capture to print. This presentation is co-sponsored by Moab Fine Art papers.

More details coming soon on the [B+H Event Space site](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/EventSpace.jsp)
