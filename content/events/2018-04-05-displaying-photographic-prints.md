Preparing and displaying your work can be as easy or as complicated as you want it to be. If your photo is destined for a frame on your desk at work, Les’s presentation is not for you. There are plenty of options available to take care of this need. On the other hand, if you have a photograph that you have been itching to get on the wall, whether it be in your home, office, or an art gallery, Les’ presentation should help orient you in the world of mounting and display.

Les Picker has been photographing since the age of 11 and has since photographed for National Geographic Society publications and many other consumer and corporate magazines and newspapers. Les was named Best Travel Photographer for the prestigious Canada Northern Lights Award. He is a resident of Havre De Grace and is in demand as a keynote speaker, lecturer and judge for photography competitions.

There will be a $5 admission fee. (unless you are an annual pre-paid member)
