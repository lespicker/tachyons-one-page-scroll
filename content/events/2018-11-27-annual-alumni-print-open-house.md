Each year our studio holds a day to honor the alumni of our digital printing workshops. Alumni gather for a "no-holds-barred" use of our large format printers, archival inks and Moab Fine Art Papers, creating works of art for friends and relatives for holiday giving. Large prints, small prints, 6-foot panos... makes no difference. The idea is to have fun and advance ones digital printing skills, creating fine art on the finest art papers made. 

Sponsored by Moab Fine Art Papers, the day is a fun-filled time for all. I sometimes wonder if people attend for the chance to print or for my wife's famed (and award-winning... seriously!) desserts. Either way it is a raucous treat for all.
