The Maryland Photography Alliance (MPA) is a union of 17 independent photography clubs throughout the State of Maryland.   MPA promotes collaboration, cooperation, and sharing of resources among member clubs. Through a strong alliance, individual club members will have greater access to enrichment opportunities.

Judging was performed by Greg Holden, an instructor of photography at the Capital Photography Center, Bob Leonard, Chair of Mid-Atlantic PSA Chapter and Jim Roy of the Potomac Society of Stereo Photographers.

### The contest was sponsored by Nations Photo Lab
  
An exhibit of the award-winning images, and other critically acclaimed photographs will be on exhibit starting January 9 through April 8, 2019.
