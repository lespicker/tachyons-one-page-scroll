I have four openings available for my annual Fall workshop in the incomparable Acadia National Park on the rocky Maine coast. I personally consider Acadia the crown jewel of our park system and Fall is the prime time to photograph there. The crowds have thinned and the burst of color that eastern forests bless us with every year makes the Maine coast something special indeed.

The 4-day workshop is being offered through Nikonians, where I am a faculty member for the Nikonians Academy. This is a terrific, exciting and fun-filled experience. There are plenty of opportunities for individualized instruction, group discussions, exposure to new equipment and techniques that will take you to the proverbial "next level" in your photography, whatever level you bring with you.
