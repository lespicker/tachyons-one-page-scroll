Since I'm a travel photographer and writer, I was asked to nominate my favorite beaches for a compendium that is [published online](https://www.flightnetwork.com/blog/worlds-50-best-beaches/) and that gets worldwide media attention. The results were just released to much fanfare. This website polls lots of travel professionals to determine the world's 50 best beaches, so I guess I shouldn't feel guilty about weighting the contest with my biases. 

For my money, a beach isn't really for sunbathing, swimming, relaxing or building sand castles. My ratings for a beach revolve around one simplistic notion; is it absolutely great for photography? I'm sure that I'm probably the only reviewer who makes his picks with so narrow a focus, but hey, they asked. 

As it turns out, a couple of my picks made it to the final list of the Top Fifty. That's probably because those very same places offer much more than just photo opps. I rarely notice that, though, since I'm usually at those beaches at sunrise or sunset. 

In fact, I admit that it's probably kinda sad that beaches, for me, serve such a utilitarian purpose. So, here's my goal for 2018. Between sunrise and sunset I will make a determined effort to enjoy just relaxing on one of those "50 Best Beaches". Yes, just relax. I can see myself doing that already.

Hmmm, those images I just took at sunrise, maybe I should upload them into my computer. I should really be cleaning my lenses right  now. Whoa, maybe I should look at the beach from another camera angle...
