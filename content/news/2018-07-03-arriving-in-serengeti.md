We were picked up by our guides at the dirt strip airport on the Serengeti in late afternoon, after spending four adrenaline fueled days in Uganda visiting with the mountain gorillas in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park. 

The June sun was beating down on us, but this early in the season it was not uncomfortably warm. It was approximately a 90-minute drive from the airstrip to our amazing Thomson Safari tent camp, located deep in the Serengeti, truly a photographer's dream. I asked my assistant (my wife) to keep a record of any wildlife sightings we might see en route to the camp. Ready for that list?

Driving down the dusty, bumpy dirt roads of Serengeti National Park, we were stunned by the abundance we saw in those 90 minutes of actual driving although, in truth, that drive ended up taking us three photo-stop hours. Here's what we saw: Zebras, Wildebeests, Hartebeests, Massai Giraffes, Hyenas, Mongoose, a Bat-Eared Fox, Jackals, Ostriches, Lionesses, and a lone hippopotamus thrown in for good luck. We arrived just at the start of the annual migration of zebras and wildebeests and they were swarming all around us in herds as far as we could see.

As we were to witness over the next week, the predators were equally awaiting their arrival.
