I just came across one of the best, most instructive photography videos I have ever seen. If you are into street photography, this one is a must-see. This video will improve your street photography like none other.

Those of you who are regular readers of my blog know of my praise for [Thomas Leuthard](http://thomas.leuthard.photography/), a Swiss photographer who has gained international plaudits for his brash and unapologetic approach to black and white street photography. I always include the disclaimer that I do not completely agree with his in-your-face, no-permission-needed attitude. However, I look with admiration at his stunning imagery that captures urban life like very few street photographers around today.
