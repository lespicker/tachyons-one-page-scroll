For those of you who have never experienced the wonderful country and people of Sri Lanka, please allow me to show you a sample of what is in store for you if and when you go. My assistant, Bob, and I put together a [5-minute video](https://youtu.be/-lNOxQcLmV0), using some of my images and video clips from Sri Lanka, mixed with images taken by participants in the recent photography tour I led there in March, 2016.

Our 11-day tour took us around the central and coastal portions of the island nation, photographing all along the way. Like in previous years, the reaction from our participants were uniformly positive, to make an understatement. The Sri Lankan people are simply wonderful; warm, hospitable and highly photogenic. The landscapes are spectacular and the wildlife incredible. 

So, take a look at this short video and see for yourself. And, whether for photography or just plain tourism, put Sri Lanka on your bucket list.
