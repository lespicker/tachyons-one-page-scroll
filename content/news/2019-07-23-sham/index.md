Returning last week from the Arctic reminds me, yet again, of a critically important role that all nature photographers have a duty to perform. 

I'll put it simply; if you are not an environmentalist you are not a true nature photographer. If your goal is to simply grab those beautiful scenics or dramatic wildlife shots without giving back, you are basically a sham. Yes, those are harsh words, but even if you disagree with me, if you will be open-minded enough to read on, perhaps I can convince you. 

What is an environmentalist? As a former environmental educator and with advanced degrees in ecology, I won't bore you with technical jargon. Those of us who consider ourselves nature photographers need to adhere to some basic principles as environmentalists. First, we need to commit to understand the environments in which we capture our images. It is not enough to selfishly come home with images of lions on the hunt in the savannas of Africa or elephant families rearing their young. We must also understand their shrinking habitat, the relentless poaching done to feed the Chinese and southeast Asian appetite for wildlife body parts, the complex interactions between wildlife and indigenous people trying to earn a living.

Then we are obligated to tell those stories whenever we share our images with others, whether friends and relatives or when we show them at camera clubs or even larger gatherings. Why? Because we have been privileged to witness nature in its amazing glory. We take workshops that bring us to the very best locations in the very best light. We research beautiful areas and go through machinations to get there. Most people are not so obsessed. We must teach them what they have not experienced firsthand. Help them understand that our natural world is under siege, unprecedented in recorded history, but that we can all be instruments of change.

Just last week I returned from a photo trip to the Arctic, a region that is undergoing major stresses. Pack ice is shrinking at an alarming rate, glaciers are disappearing, polar bears are critically endangered, permafrost is melting, bird species are threatened and I am only referencing a smattering of those ecological stresses. I am reminded every day of the need to educate others about what we are doing to our precious planet and how we can change course if we have the political will. 

As photographers we also have an obligation to support those organizations that battle immense odds every day to protect and replenish our natural world. These are the people who finance armed rangers to protect elephants from poaching, create and maintain protected natural areas, convince legislators to pass policies that will mitigate our most destructive tendencies toward Mother Earth and, when necessary, go to court to reverse short-sighted policies that are decimating a robust and diverse natural world that our grandchildren may never see. Support them financially, volunteer your services, get your friends to join with you.

We live in a highly complex world today. The growth of ill-informed, anti-science attitudes is shocking to rational, educated people. The climate change, global warming deniers, those who refuse to confront the facts before them, boggles my mind. We live on the razor's edge as far as the survival of our natural world goes. But if nature photographers take up the mantle and everyone of us does his or her part, then we might just make a dent in people's willingness to sacrifice a little in order to leave a better world for future generations. 

So, go out and photograph, deepen your understanding of the natural world you capture, become an ambassador, contribute money and time, and educate others. Make your photography count.
