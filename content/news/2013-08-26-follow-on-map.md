Right now I'm in the Houston airport, waiting for my flight to Calgary. (How does an airline figure that it is cost-effective to route one from Baltimore to Houston in order to get to Calgary?) I'll land at around 9:00 PM (11:00 PM my time), after 11 hours of flying and layovers.

In any event, after a few hours sleep, I'll be up before dawn to photograph, starting with sunrise at the pond that you see at the top of this blog, Wedge Pond in Kananaskis Regional Park. I'm not sure the foliage will be at spectacular as you see here, but I'm saying my prayers that the day is clear to partly cloudy, so that the alpenglow on the mountains behind the pond will light them up. That's my story, anyway. 

If you'd like to follow my travels at any point during the next two weeks, beginning tomorrow (Tuesday, August 27), [here is a link](https://share.delorme.com/2f58e8e2aee4429697d785cf1d11b9c3) to a mapping program that will track my position every 15 minutes or so via satellite. 

If you're planning a trip to the Canadian Rockies at some point, you'll get a fix on some prime photo spots. I'm using a DeLorme InReach SE GPS Communicator,a first for me. I'll be photographing alone for the first 5 days so I always take a monitoring system along just in case. It has a built-in emergency rescue beacon. Stay tuned for a comprehensive review of the InReach when I'm done with this trip.
