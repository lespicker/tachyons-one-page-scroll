Sorry, but I have to get this one off my chest. After listening to the umpteenth rendition of the Flight Attendant Safety 101 script, I'd like to know one thingâ€¦

<!--more-->

Is there anyone in this world who does not know how to buckle a seat belt? Anyone? One single person? In the deepest recesses of
Africa or the Amazon they have Land Rovers, so the locals have surely seen someone buckling a seatbelt. Yet on every single flight the attendants have to waste their time and ours showing us how to buckle a damned seatbelt! 

I have a better idea. Why don't the attendants just ask whomever does **not** know how to buckle a seatbelt to raise their hands. Then they can ask just those miscreants to stand up (but please do not block the aisle). They can hand out a certificate or, better yet, a seat belt lapel pin to the folks once they pass a test (sort of like a No-Idiot-Left-Behind graduation award). 

Thanks. I feel better. Now, where is that damned seat belt?
