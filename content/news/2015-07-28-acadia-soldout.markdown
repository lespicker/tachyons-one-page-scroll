Just a quick update...

My Acadia National Park workshop slated for October 15-19 is now sold out. This is truly a fantastic workshop, as the Maine coast resplendent in Fall foliage is incredible. If you are interested in experiencing it next year, stay tuned for my announcement, which will be posted in November. Then, be sure to register ASAP!
