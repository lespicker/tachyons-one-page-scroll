Without a doubt, Fujifilm's latest announcement of the release of the GFX 100S (photo above) will shake up the market. I predict that within the next two years, medium format photography will capture an ever increasing share of the market due to this bombshell, which Hasselblad (and maybe Sony) is likely to imitate. Even so, I plan on sticking to my trusty GFX 100 and GFX 50S and I'm here to tell you why.
	
### Revolutionary?
	
I really don't think I've ever used the word revolutionary when a new camera model has been introduced in the past 50 years. Evolutionary, yes, but that's about as far as I've been willing to stretch. 
	
Still, I'll say I'm standing on the very edge of calling the GFX100S revolutionary and for one major reason. Fujifilm has managed to piggyback on its grand-slam success with the GFX 100 to price the GFX 100S at a point where it is competitive with higher end DSLRs and mirrorless cameras. Pair that with the legendary Fujinon lenses and, well, you definitely have the makings of a revolution. 
	
At $6,000, you get 102 MP resolution for $500 less than I paid for my GFX 50S (50 MP) three years ago and $4,000 less than I paid for my GFX 100 just 18 months ago. 
	
With the 100S you also get a camera that is far lighter, accepts all GF lenses and has several incremental improvements over the 100. 
	
### Why Stick With the GFX 100?
	
I have made a couple of video reviews of the [50S](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB_YxWmDJVw) and the [100](https://youtu.be/8Q1D0B8bVRU). And while I still use my 50S, I have absolutely fallen in love with my 100. It is the first camera system that I feel is fully customized for my particular shooting style. In fact, its customization capability is one of its strongest features. It only took a few outings for me to say that the camera bonded to my style. Despite its being a heavy camera, the ergonomics are terrific. And I say this after being a Nikon and Hasselblad digital photographer for 50 years.

Sure, the 100S is a fantastic camera from all indications. But it lacks a few things that I consider essential for my personal shooting style. The first is its inability to accommodate the optional articulated view finder. I rely on that capability for nearly every assignment I take on. That viewfinder works on both the 50S and the 100 and I switch it between the two, depending on which one I plan to use the most over the next few hours.

Second, the 100S has only one battery. My 100 has a tray for two. Granted that Fuji claims the 100S battery will last around 500 shots under ideal conditions, but I rarely shoot under those conditions. If I'm in Yukon Territory or Antarctica, I want two batteries in camera (and 4-6 more next to my body!) ready to go. 
	
Finally, the 100S does not have a vertical grip, another necessity in my line of work. 
	
Now, please don't get me wrong. I feel the 100S is a great camera based on the specs. And your shooting style may work comfortably with the 100S. But ultimately I must say I'm not tempted... yet!?
