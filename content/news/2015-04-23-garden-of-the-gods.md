I was in Colorado Springs today, shooting in the must-stop for photographers, the Garden of the Gods. Few places in the world afford so many photo opps as this unique park.

I just rambled about in the early morning light, before the skies opened up and rained out any further photography. Hardly anyone was there, another reason to get up early. 

The opening scenic was shot on a tripod with a Nikon D800 with a 24-70 f2.8 lens set at 52mm, ISO 100, 1/40 @ f11 and -2/3 EV. 

This next image I captured jut before left. I liked the way the sun was highlighting these dormant trees against the red rocks of the park.

This was shot with the same setup, but at 1/6 @ f16 with the lens at 36mm. 

Colorado Springs is about 2 hours from Denver, so if you are in the city for any reason, you would do well to take a day trip to the Garden of the Gods.
