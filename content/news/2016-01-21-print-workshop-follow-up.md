We just completed another of our [fine art printing workshops](http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/workshops/upcoming-workshops.html#printing) and boy was it fun! Yes, we were a bit discombobulated at the beginning of the day, as one of the printer profile sites we use changed its Internet location and format and we scampered to change our setup instructions. But our participants were patient and in good spirits (Bob and I were neither!) as we fixed the problem and settled in for a productive day. To quote Forrest Gump: "Stuff happens!"

Once we were ready to go, Bob and I covered many of the fine points of creating the fine art print, including equipment and supplies, color management, post-processing for the best output on paper - very different from electronic screens - and paper selection. 

By lunchtime everyone was eager to print and for the following 4+ hours that is exactly what we did. Unlike most print workshops, our folks walked away with anywhere from 2-5 large format, 17x22" prints. As one participant emailed me after the event: "Les a hearty thank you to you and Bob. I was very impressed with your studio and the level of instruction.  I may have learned more today about processing and printing than in all of the years I've been working at digital photography. Best of all my wife loves the prints." That's the take-away for me. If your spouse loves the prints, then all is right with the world. 

Our next print workshop will be held on Saturday, April 23. If you are interested, you can [learn more here](http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/workshops/upcoming-workshops.html#printing). Our website includes comments from past participants as well as a description of what you can expect from the workshop.
