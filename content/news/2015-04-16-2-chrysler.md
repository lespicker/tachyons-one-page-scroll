Just a quick share...

I was walking along 42nd street in Manhattan from the subway to my hotel and had just passed Bryant Park when I looked up and saw the Chrysler building on this clear night. I stopped to take an iPhone snap of the top of the building all lit up. But when I walked another block and approached Grand Central Station, I saw another image entirely.

I stopped and composed this iPhone image of the sculpture atop the terminal, with the Chrysler Building looming above it. I kinda liked it and imported it into Snapseed right on my iPhone. I used one of the filters to add grain and, for better or worse, here it is.
