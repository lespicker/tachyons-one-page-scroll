I am frequently asked about shooting panorama images; the best techniques to use, what equipment works best, how to stitch the separate images together, and so on. My [video on panorama captures](https://youtu.be/edgmob9gtQ4) already has more than 70,000 views on YouTube.

But, if there one thing that the mere mention of frightens off many aspiring panoramists (did I just invent a word?) it is the term nodal points or pupil entry points. Huh?

I'm not going to go into a detailed explanation of nodal points - more accurately pupil entry points - in this blog. That's because I just completed a [video](https://youtu.be/IFQHoCjFTn8) on the topic. Suffice it to say that if you are as anal as I am and want pixel perfect, huge panoramas with crazy amounts of detail in them, you should understand what the nodal point is and, more importantly, how to determine it for every lens you might use to take panos. I'll go a step further to say that if you are using a zoom telephoto to capture panos, you should know the nodal points for the focal lengths you use most often to capture them. 

That's it. If you want the nitty gritty, [take a look at my nodal point video](https://youtu.be/IFQHoCjFTn8) and my [panorama instructional video](https://youtu.be/edgmob9gtQ4). Guaranteed to work better than Ambien!
