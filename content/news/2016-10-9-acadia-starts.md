Got up for sunrise yesterday preparing for my annual Acadia National Park workshop. Scooted over to Boulder Beach to wait for the sun to come up. What a lovely morning it was.

As always I'm looking forward to introducing another group of workshop participants to the magic of Acadia with its rocky coast, deep forests, mountains, streams, lakes, fishing villages and so much more. I lived nearby for ten years and did my graduate work in this park, so it is always a joy to be back, sharing its photographic mysteries, ones that change by the day, hour, even minute!

My colleague Tony Sweet will be leading a different group at the same time and I'm sure we'll literally cross paths at least once during our stay. Always look forward to that, too!
