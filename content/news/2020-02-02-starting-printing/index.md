In our Maryland studio, we print in excess of a thousand prints every year. We have four large format printers, we host workshops a few times a year and I lecture extensively on the topic. Granted, we are experienced print makers. 

But what about you? Perhaps you are a novice to printing or have never even attempted it. It may appear complicated, daunting, confusing, too expensive, or only for pros. Maybe you wonder what you will do with all the gorgeous prints you create. If you are even remotely considering extending your photographic art to include fine art prints, allow me to deal with each of these issues and more. 

### Getting Started

**The Decision**. Print or not? Don't digital media - think Facebook, Instagram, 500px, and a thousand others - offer me enough ways to share my images? The short answer is, sure. If your intent is to only quickly share with family and friends, stick to social media. But, if you have seen fine art prints in a gallery, in a book, or ones a colleague produced, you may have already been bitten by the bug and want to join in.

Fine art prints are another way, a wonderful way, to share your art. Historically, prints have been the yardstick by which one's photography was measured. In fact, until relatively recently, they were the **only** way to even see one's photography. 

But delving into prints requires something that isn't often talked about. One has to change one's mindset. We are bombarded by digital imagery every day. We see our images on a monitor that blows the image out to us at 1000 to 1 contrast ratios (or even more with newer screen technology). A print utilizes only reflected light at ratios closer to 100:1. That requires one to  make a mental adjustment and to expand one's [visual literacy](). 

**The Expense**. Printing can be an expensive addiction. Note that I say can, but it needn't necessarily be.

First of all, printers today are miraculous technology, yet they are an incredible value. A very good printer, like the Canon ProGraf 100, can be had on sale for under $500. A great printer, like the Canon Prograf 1000 or the Epson 3880 can be had for $1,000. They will last for years. 

The financial pain is in the inks. A full set of 12 inks for the ProGraf 1000 will set you back around $650. But, unless you print like we do in our studio, that set will last a good long time. Two tips: don't let your printer go unused for too long as clogging issues can happen with your printhead, an expensive repair. We recommend that you send at least one print through your printer every week or two. Also, don't use off-brand inks. That bears repeating: only use the manufacturer's ink or you will get horrible prints and a voided warranty. 

**Too Complicated?** Not really. There is a lot of junk science and uptight print nerds out there whose sole job seems to be to scare people away from fine art printing. Their websites are full of complex graphs and charts, all designed to show off their brilliance, with a warning that Chucky will get you if you don't adhere to their absurd demands. Sure, a few of them are printing experts, but I have yet to see one of these naysayers who is also a great photographer with great prints. 

Printing has changed so radically in the past decade I hardly know where to begin. The short of it is this. Do your research, take a workshop from an experienced studio with lots of positive testimonials, and get your hands wet (oops, that last phrase is from when I used to print in my wet darkroom, soaked in carcinogenic chemicals). 

You may also want to download my 163-page, comprehensive, fully illustrated [guide to fine art printing](https://fineartprintebook.com/), which you can get free for a limited time. The website from where you get the download also has a section of case studies giving you advice on techniques, troubleshooting, and lots  more. 

**It's too Confusing**. It is when you first begin. There is a learning curve to climb and there will be initial frustrations as you up your game. However, there is one secret that will get you past all these startup blues. **PRACTICE**. 

We recommend buying a stack of two types of decent photo paper when you start out; matte and semi-gloss or satin. Then practice and practice more. Learn the subtleties of getting the full tonal range out of your images. Learn how much contrast to put in the mid-tones to get a great print. 

**Ask for help**. Join a camera club and ask experienced print makers for help. Take a workshop. Research online (but be careful of those techno-nerds!).

**What Do I do With Those Prints?** Frame 'em and hang 'em. When you run out of wall space, give them as gifts. Adhere them to Gatorboard for inexpensive gifts (we offer a workshop on that). Decorate your kids or grandkids rooms. Print your own greeting cards adorned with your own images. Put on a mini-exhibit at your library, church, synagogue or mosque. Make a portfolio that showcases your finest work. 

I know that for my work, I don't consider an image complete until I see it in print. That used to be only in my magazine work, but as my photography has evolved, it now means on a sheet of gorgeous fine art paper. 

The key point of all this is if you are curious or (heaven forbid) even serious about fine art printing, just do it! Jump in and have fun.
