I'm back in Hawaii, working but also enjoying this almost paradise. I say almost because I'm on the island of Maui with its traffic and overbuilt shoreline in spots.

But there is more to Maui than glitter and glitz. The island actually boasts thousands of acres of undeveloped, pristine land and some of the most gorgeous shoreline on Earth. 

It has been raining since I arrived three days ago. There is flooding in places, but overall the island is weathering it nicely, as it has for a million years or so. Besides, what creates all that lush, scenic tropical vegetation but rain, so bring it on!

I took a quick break this evening to drive a few minutes up the road to Kahana, a site I enjoy photographing. Sunset did not look too promising, so I left with only my trusty iPhone 5s. Sea turtles were swarming in the waters right offshore, and two whales were blowing in the distance. Idyllic, but no money shots. 

Still, I did manage to take this pano with my iPhone. I hope you enjoy it.
