I've said this before: Iceland is incredible. Everywhere you turn is a photo opp. Here's a quick one I'll share from my travels today. 

<!--more-->

Today dawned sunny and bright, so I headed up the east coast. I was driving down the road when I passed a small stream that I've passed at least 3-4 times before. Each of those times it was raining or cloudy, so I've never had good results with this scene. 

In this case I used my Nikon D800 with a 24-70mm f2.8 Nikkor lens mounted on a Gitzo 3541 with a Really Right Stuff BH-55 ballhead and a RRS leveling base, and a Singh Ray polarizer. I also used a 2-stop neutral grad and a 4-stop neutral density filter to slow down the water.

I shot four pano images (and only four, since I was hurrying to get to a destination up the coast for sunset) and three bracketed images with my 14-24 Nikkor. Then I was back in the car and didn't see these again until tonight's download. 

I put the four images through PTGUI and saved it to this blog. That's it. No further processing, although I will probably work on it once I get back to the studio. In any case, I just thought I'd share with you what you see in Iceland around nearly every curve. Stay tuned for more.
