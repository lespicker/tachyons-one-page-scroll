Describing China, or better yet a photo adventure to China, is nothing short of absurd. With 20% of the world's population, 56 ethnic groups, 5 main languages with more than 200 dialects, and so many spectacular landforms, China is indescribable. 

Yes, there are the typical tourist spots that every photographer aspires to capture. But those images you may see in brochures were taken typically with restricted permission or on rare weather days. Given those facts, how does a photographer prepare for a trip to China? Here are some of my tips, having spent the better part of a month traveling through China, with five  internal flights and hundreds of road miles. 

**Do a Mental Reboot**. Traveling in China is not like touring the U.S.A or Europe. You will be in a totally different culture and must adjust your expectations to suit. 

**Read Up**. Read all you can about the Chinese people, customs and behaviors prior to arriving. For example, orderly lines are rare. When a bus door opens, be prepared for a crush of people arriving from all directions, pushing and shoving to get in. There is nothing personal in this behavior., Learn to push back and all will be fine.  

**Crowds**. China has 1.4 billion people in a space the approximate size of the USA. Furthermore, most of those people live in areas that you will probably want to visit. This creates huge challenges for photographers, so read on to be prepared. The Chinese concept of personal space differs from Western concepts. Being aware of this and just shrugging it off is a good idea. 

**Guard Your Stuff**. China is remarkably free of bodily crime, since penalties, especially when tourists are involved, are severe. The same does not apply to property theft. Make sure you have solid protection for your gear. Keep it in front of you as much as possible. If using a photo backpack, make sure it is resistant to slash-and-grab theft. Never leave gear unattended. 

**Crowd Control**. Learn to manage crowds for your picture taking. In most tourist locations you will not be able to avoid crowds of people in your shots, but you can do things to minimize or even eliminate the issue. First, using a neutral density filter can work wonders in reducing crowds. You'll need a tripod for that (see below), but it will be worth your while. Second, incorporate the crowds to produce pleasing travel images. Thirdly, try for a higher vantage point so that you can cut crowd interference to a minimum. 

**Speaking of Tripods**. Be very careful when using a tripod. The crowds can be so dense that camera disasters are a constant threat. If you are traveling with someone, ask them to stand next to the tripod while you shoot. If you leave your tripod alone, even for a few seconds to bend over and retrieve a spare lens from your bag, be prepared for a stranger to walk over and peer through your lens to see what you are shooting. I have even had one woman actually manipulate my camera to see what images I had already captured! Please understand that this is first and foremost a compliment. With a tripod and fancy camera you look like you are a pro who knows what you are doing. In fact, in 90% of these encounters the person will immediately raise his camera to take a shot exactly from where you are shooting. 

In this image which I took with my iPhone, a man walked over to one of my clients and actually leaned on her back to take the same shot she was!! 

**Avoid Holidays**. Due to the rising income level of Chinese citizens, holidays are a major time for families to travel to the same sights you want to be. I cannot stress how big an issue this is, so be sure to plan your trip so that it does not coincide with major holiday periods. 

**Be Patient**. There will be times when patience rules. Wait for the crowd next to a guard rail to move so you have a place to set up a tripod or just stand with your camera hand-held. Allow extra time in each locale to scout out vantage points from where you will shoot. 

**Good Guides Rule!**. Have a Mandarin speaking guide who understands photography and photographers. It's very frustrating when a guide takes you to scenic spot in mid-day with unmanageable contrast. Make sure your tour agency has experience with photographers, including a willingness on their part to arrange sunrise and sunset shoots. 

**Equipment**. China is so diverse in terms of photo opps, it is hard to recommend specific equipment to bring. Wide angle lenses predominate due to the architectural, market and landscape marvels that abound. But a short tele is good to have in places like the Rainbow Mountains where you want to take an extraction shot. Have a good quality backpack because you will be doing a lot of walking, as well as good hiking shoes. 

**Accessories**. Make sure to take enough storage cards, as camera stores are only found in cities and may be counterfeit. Bring cleaning tools, as dust is everywhere. Bring good quality personal face masks, as dust is everywhere (pollution, too). 

**Have Fun**. China is a smorgasbord of wonderful experiences. Chief among them is the food. My visits to my local U.S.A. Chinese restaurants have been cut by 75% since I ate authentic Chinese food on our trip.  Indulge, relax and enjoy!

The Chinese people themselves are largely wonderful. Many speak English and are eager to converse with foreigners. They love taking pictures with you and I can only imagine what they tell friends when they show them back at home.
