I am just so excited to announce that I was awarded First Place for Photography in Canada's Northern Lights Award for travel journalism.

I'll have more to say about the award in a blog next week, after I speak with the organizers. I was just informed today via phone tag and email. The award will be presented at a ceremony in April in San Francisco. For now, I can only thank the tourism folks in Canada, who have been so helpful to me whenever I cross the border to photograph and write about their spectacular country and wonderful people.

The winning photograph(s) were taken in Yukon Territory and for that I especially thank the Yukon Tourism folks and Jim Kemshead, in particular. Great bunch of folks fortunate enough to live in one of the last unspoiled wildernesses in North America.

More later...
