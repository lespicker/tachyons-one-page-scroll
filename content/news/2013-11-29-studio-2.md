Quick update...

It's been a few of weeks of construction now, but my home studio is coming together very nicely, thanks to Terry, my General Contractor. 

Last week the framing was completed and the electric and plumbing roughed in. This week the workers hung the sheetrock, interrupted, of course, by Thanksgiving. 

Here a couple of images and one video of the construction, which might be of interest to other photographers since we are installing a curved wall to display a very wide mural that we will print ourselves. That wall required some attention to detail and we were blessed to have real pros like William, with more than 30 years experience, do the installation.

The photo above shows William wetting the sheetrock, which enables it to conform to the curve.

[This video link](http://youtu.be/PtQNh7smzxA) shows William and his boss installing the first curved sheet. Note how William has to instruct his boss on what to do!

This image shows the just installed curved sheets with a slap coat of "mud" on top.

I'll continue to document the mural aspect as it develops. In fact, Bob and I are considering offering an opportunity for 3 or 4 of you to witness the creation of the mural in person and learn about photo mural post-processing, printing and coating. Stay tuned for more information.
