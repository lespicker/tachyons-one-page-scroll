I just returned from Sri Lanka, where I did several safaris in various national parks. While in Udawalawe National Park I noticed an interesting behavior that the Indian elephants exhibited. I’ve seen lots of Asian elephants before, as well as African elephants, but somehow I missed this particular behavior.

A single female was standing not far off the gravel road, eating away peacefully. What I noticed was that each time she took a good strong pull of grass, she wrapped her trunk tight around it and repeatedly beat the grass on the ground, as you can [see in this iPhone video](http://youtu.be/LqPRXR_RdvE?list=UUq6TJZjUFp877PkgeJkETew).

Our guide told us that the elephants rid the grass of sand and biting ants this way. I thought that was neat and worth sharing.
