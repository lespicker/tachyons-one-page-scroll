We just completed another of our limited seating fine art printing workshops and I thought I'd share some images and a video with you.

[Here is a link](https://youtu.be/aVV_d0jckxE) to a 1-minute video showing our attendees hard at work cranking out prints. 

One of the joys of our work is that we get a chance to make lots of folks really, really happy by seeing their work become "real" on a fine art print done on museum-quality Moab papers. Take a look at Kevin Duncan, one of our attendees, after he nailed a 24" x 66" pano print! Pure joy!

Our clients typically get to take home anywhere from three to eight prints, which more than makes up for the cost of the workshop. Plus, we always have a fun time.
