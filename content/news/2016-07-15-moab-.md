[Les Picker Fine Art Photography](http://lesterpickerphoto.com) is proud to announce that Les has been named a [Moab Master photographer](http://moabpaper.com/moab-masters/). Moab Masters are a select group of international professional photographers who have exhibited the highest standards in digital fine art photographic printing.

[Moab](http://moabpaper.com/) is part of the Legion Paper family of products, North America's premier distributor of fine art papers and museum board, sourced from mills around the world. Moab is committed to developing innovative products, which empower visual thinkers to share their inspiration. Legion Paper maintains offices in New York City, Los Angeles and Moab, with distribution facilities in Los Angeles and New Jersey. 

Les is already a Master photographer for [Museo Fine Art Media](http://www.museofineart.com/) and will continue his association with them. Both fine art paper companies are sponsors of his highly praised, [small group print workshops](http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/workshops/upcoming-workshops.html#printing). 

"I am honored to be named a Moab Master," Les said. "While it is a recognition of my landscape, wildlife and travel photography, it also recognizes the passion our studio brings to our fine art printing. Moab papers are truly extraordinary and enable me to achieve my photographic vision."
