If you are in the area of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on April 11, or interested enough in photography to travel a bit, I will be giving the keynote speech at the 5th annual Light and Creativity Conference. Coordinated by the Harrisburg Camera Club, the event is a major photo gathering offering workshops and vendor booths to allow photographers of all levels to learn, interact and leave with new and improved skills.

My keynote will be on a topic that I am excited about, namely a way to look at one's photography differently and to challenge both beginners and pros alike to grow in new directions. This reflects my observations of the work of dozens of professional photographers, where I've teased out common characteristics they exhibit to advance their skill sets and generate new perspectives on our world. This process can be applicable to photographers of all skill levels. 

I will also be offering two workshops explaining how I take an image from capture to print. My assistant, Robert Boyer, who is a Master Printmaker, has been instrumental in co-developing this 90-minute workshop that I will offer twice that day. Bob will be there to answer all the tech questions that I'm certain will pop up. [Museo Fine Art Papers](http://www.museofineart.com) is sponsoring my workshop and has donated starter packs of their fine papers to give away as door prizes. 

I will be joined by two other incredible pro photographers, both of whom will offer their own workshops to attendees. Carl Sander Socolow will show how to blend traditional street and documentary photography to reflect the commonness of the human experience. Joe LeFevre will give attendees 25 tips for improving their landscape and nature photography.
