I'm back in The Big Apple this week, attending The Association of International Photography Art Dealers show. "More than 80 of the world's leading photography art galleries," are here, according to AIPAD and it's an incredible sight to see.

On opening night collectors, gallery owners and photographers from around the world were present, exploring the works, past and present, of notable photographers. Original prints by Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, Gordon Parks and others were on display and for sale, with prices upwards of $50,000 a print. I have to admit being in front of a print handled by Ansel Adams himself is a humbling experience. 

What was strange to me, as a landscape, wildlife and travel photographer was how the only 'realistic' nature imagery were from past masters. Photography has evolved, whether for better or worse, into abstract art forms, as artists try to expand their work into untested conceptual areas. At times I felt as if I was in a time warp, with me having been left behind. I struggled to make artistic sense of many of the works I saw. Still, as a working artist, I find that it's good to be exposed to what galleries are selling, or at least trying to sell. 

Of course, the one thing I couldn't resist was going to the penultimate toy stores for photographers, B and H photo and Adorama (why aren't they next door to each other to make our lives a bit easier?). Oddly, neither one had what I was searching for. But, The Big Apple being what it is, I managed to find what I needed in another store.

Am I the only one feeling like a kid in a candy store at these fine photo fantasy palaces? Lots of treats that I'd like, but few that I really need, at least at this point in my career. Oh, well, there's always my next visit to The Big Apple.
