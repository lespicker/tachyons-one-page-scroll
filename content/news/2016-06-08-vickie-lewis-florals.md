I love looking at some floral images, although I admit I do not particularly enjoy taking them. Oh, I've taken a few nice ones over the years (actually, decades would be more accurate). But I've never managed to become proficient with it.

Just today I received an email from Vickie Lewis, a National Geographic Creative photographer whose work I both respect and admire. Vickie has managed to take stunning portraits of some of the most interesting people in the world. 

She has just published a [how-to article on Floral Photography](http://digital-photography-school.com/how-to-create-gorgeous-flower-images-using-a-flashlight-and-a-reflector/) for anyone who aspires to improve their skills in this area. With just the use of a white piece of cardboard and a flashlight, Vickie has achieved some beautiful florals, as you can see from the lead image. 

Have a go at it. I know I will, thanks to Vickie's motivating me.
