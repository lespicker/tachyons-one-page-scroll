There are tons of photo contests out there. But if you're looking for one that's fun, as well as challenging, you should consider BenQ's [Family Pet Photo Contest](https://www.benq.com/en-us/content/aqcolor-professional-monitor-events-tips-support.html?&utm_source=influencer_lester_pickerutm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pet_contest). 

As I'm sure many of you know (and for those of you who don't), [BenQ](https://www.benq.com/en-us/index.html) is the manufacturer of arguably the finest and most affordable large format Adobe RGB monitors available today. In fact, we use one in our studio (the SW321C) for the finest image reproduction and most accurate color proofing prior to generating one of our fine art prints.  

I get lots of contest announcements, some of them interesting, others not so much. But when I looked into the BenQ pet contest I was pleasantly surprised, because to me it looks like the perfect way to break those Covid restraints. Bottom line? It sounds like fun!

The way to enter is about the simplest I've seen. As BenQ says: "Take a photo of your pet. The more creative, the better!" Then you follow their clear directions and - Voila! - you're in! The contest judges are top-tier photographers, so make sure you consider composition, lighting, crisp focus and, above all, drama or humor. 

The prizes are pretty awesome, including BenQ monitors and cash, plus the satisfaction you'll feel from just entering and the recognition you'll get if you're a winner.

As with any contest, be sure to read the Terms & Conditions before entering. 

The contest closes May 30th, so capture those pet moments and enter. It's a great way to hone your skills, get practice with contests, and have fun.
