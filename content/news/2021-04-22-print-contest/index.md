### A First-of-Its-Kind

I'm pleased to report that I'll be a judge in the [2021 Open Print Contest & Exhibition](https://paperartscollective.com) offered by The Paper Arts Collective. I join the legendary Moab Master Photographers [Jim Graham and Jim LaSala, as well as master printer Bob Boyer](https://paperartscollective.com/meet-the-judges/), in this effort. 

What makes this print contest so special is that it's designed for those who are passionate about the art of digital photographic printing. First, entry prints are standardized at 8.5 x 11" (or A4) for judging, saving entrants time and money. Second, the winners will have their images printed large by The Collective on Canon professional large format printers, using Moab fine art papers, for display in a public exhibition in a gallery outside Washington, D.C. 

### Exhibition and Prizes

Of course, I like to think that what will motivate most entrants is the desire to see their images on paper, hanging on a gallery wall, and appreciated by visitors to the gallery exhibition. But to spice up the contest, incredible prizes will be awarded for 1st, 2nd and 3rd places in each category: Color and B&W. There will also be Honorable Mentions and their work will also be hung in the exhibition. Prize sponsors include BenQ (Adobe monitors), Canon pro printers, Moab fine art paper gift certificates, X-Rite calibration packages, Nations Photo Lab gift certificates, large format prints, cash and more. Winners can choose to have their prints for sale at the exhibition, with all proceeds going to the artist. 

Entrants may submit up to 6 prints, divided as they want between the two categories.
