It's been something like 16 years, but I'm finally back in South Africa. I was last here with a group of journalists just after apartheid fell apart and Nelson Mandela returned triumphantly to Pretoria. The atmosphere was electric back then, with hope and aspiration, and no doubt some anxiety, to be seen on the faces of South Africans.

This visit will be a mix of what I hope will be amazing photography, along with an exploration of the new South Africa, which I am most eager to experience. 

Over the next three weeks I'll be spending time in the Blyde Canyon region, Kruger National Park, Addo Elephant National Park, and the Cape Town region, including Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned, and the famed Stellenbosch and their most excellent wines. I'll be driving much of the way, which I do not relish since I'll be driving on the wrong side of the car, but hopefully on the right side of the road, which in this case is on the left. 

Stay tuned. I hope to post some interesting blogs with images about our adventures over the coming weeks.
