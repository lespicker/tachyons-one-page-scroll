Independence Day is around the corner, so it's time to put out the word about my annual Fall Acadia National Park workshop. 

<!--more-->

My Acadia National Park event is slated for October 15-19. The rocky shore of Acadia should be in prime fall foliage then, so scenics should be drop-dead gorgeous. 

Every year we have a marvelous four days traveling the back roads of Acadia. I lived an hour from Acadia for 10 years and did my graduate ecology research there, so I know the park intimately. My past workshoppers have enjoyed their experiences, as evidenced by [their testimonials](http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/workshops/past-workshop.html).

If you are looking for an exciting and fun experience in one of America's premier national parks, amidst the colorful fireworks of Maine's incomparable fall foliage, waves crashing on the rocky coast, and forests filled with lush mosses and meandering streams, then [check out this workshop](http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/workshops/upcoming-workshops.html). Enrollment is strictly limited to 10 people so I can give individual attention to every participant. There are still a few spots left.
