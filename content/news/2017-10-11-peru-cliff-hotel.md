I generally do not consider myself a scaredy-cat, afraid to take prudent risks. The operative word is prudent. 

On a recent trip to Peru, I happened to look up as we drove down a rural road. I noticed a group of climbers scaling an absolutely vertical cliff face. Wanting to see where they were climbing, I pulled over. And much to my shock, I saw this.

Can you imagine staying in this "hotel"? Does one ever sleep there? I'd be up all night tethered to the sheer rock face for dear life, a blabbering idiot praying to gods that haven't been invented yet! 

Notice the man under the hotel pod in the next picture. I can only imagine the conversation...

"I feel like a breath of fresh air, honey. I'll be back in a minute."

"Don't forget your harness, helmet, gloves, pitons and ropes, dear. It rained last night and the cliff is a tad slippery."

But, hey, if you want to book into one of the Skylodge Adventure Suites at "Hotel Nightmare" [here is the link](http://naturavive.com/web/). Or [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srFKQrmL3Fg&feature=youtu.be) and experience it prudently.
