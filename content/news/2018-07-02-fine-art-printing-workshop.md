The summer 2018 edition of our fine art printing workshop is coming up quick. I can't believe we're in July already. Where did May and June go? The all-day Saturday printing workshop will be held August 4th, 2018. [There are a few spots left in this limited availability event so if you can make it sign up now.](http://workshops.lesterpickerphoto.com/page/803)

We'll have a selection of archival Moab fine art printing papers for you to use as well as the latest Canon print technology for hands-on use, including:

- Two Canon Pro-1000 printers for proofing or final art up to 17x22
- A Canon Pro-2000 available for final art work that prints 24x36 or longer for panoramic images.
- A Canon Pro-4000 available for final art that makes prints up to&hellip; ummm, let's just say **huge**.

You can proof and make as many prints as time allows to take home.  You'll get some valuable hands-on experience you can use with your own printers, as well as expert advice and assistance with optimizing your images for print.

You'll learn a ton of practical printing &mdash; what works, what doesn't. We'll explain many of the things you can get confused about online, like color management, but from a much more practical level. You'll see what we do and why, hard learned lessons after making thousands of digital fine art prints over the last decade.
