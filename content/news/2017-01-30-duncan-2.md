A few months ago I blogged about the joys of fine art printing, using as an example the panoramic print that Kevin Duncan created during one of our print workshops. I wanted to follow up whenever Kevin got it framed and displayed.

Kevin owns an accounting firm in Baltimore, Maryland and he wanted the print proudly displayed in his office, along with some of his other photography art. 

Here is the print at the framing studio:

Now the traditionally framed print hangs in his office. Wow!

Bob and I tip our hats to Kevin's photographic eye and his newfound passion for fine art prints.
