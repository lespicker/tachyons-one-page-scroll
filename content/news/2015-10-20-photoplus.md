I just returned today from leading a [wonderful workshop](http://www.lesterpickerphoto.com/workshops/upcoming-workshops.html) in Maine's Acadia National Park, an annual event that I look forward to every year. I have one day to reorient myself before heading off to the PhotoPlus International Conference and Expo.

PhotoPlus is the largest photography and imaging show in North America. More than 21,000 attendees are able to participate in lectures, photo walks in The Big Apple, master classes and more than 225 exhibitors from cameras to printers to accessories. 

I find PhotoPlus to be an exciting, motivating experience where even pros can learn much about our craft. From beginners to advanced amateurs, there is something for everyone... in fact lots of somethings. If you can possibly attend, I urge you to do so. If you do attend, please stop by Museo's exhibit, where they will be giving away samples of their papers. I'd love to meet you and talk about making luscious fine art prints.
