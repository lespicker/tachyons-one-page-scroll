Due to a major scheduling blunder on my part, we still have a couple of openings in our Acadia National Park Fall photo tour slated from October 10-14. Acadia is a spectacularly gorgeous park with mountains, seashore, forests, streams, lakes, waterfalls, lobster boats, fishermen, quaint villages and stunning Fall foliage, all packed onto an island that is easily accessible. One of the best parts of the tour are the best lobster dinners one can possibly have... and the freshest!
