## Corporate Art Installations

At Les Picker Fine Art Photography we take great pride in transforming office, hospital, and corporate environments into luscious, visually exciting living spaces. Research has clearly shown the benefits of fine art images in promoting feelings of well-being. 

We will never promote a one-size-fits-all approach to our valued clients. Instead we arrange an initial consultation where we discuss your needs and desired outcomes. We measure the available spaces and then propose a customized visual solution.  Whether it be planning an entire hospital's installation of calming naturescapes, or travel and cultural images for an international consulting company, we work with our clients to develop an individualized solution. We help you create the mood you desire, with an artful grouping of images and displays.

We offer a wide variety of display options, including traditional framed prints, modern front-mounted plexiglass or aluminum prints, backlit LED displays, window treatments, and our popular and durable wall coverings, as well as other display options. Each is briefly described below.  

### Museum-quality Traditional Prints

{{< figure src="/images/DSCF4757.jpg" >}}

We print each of our images individually in our studio, using the finest printers, archival inks and museum-quality, archival papers. We work with a custom shop to frame the images, double-matted and covered with UV protective glass or plexiglass. The finished product adds even more depth to our fine art images.

### Limited Edition Prints

For those special office areas we offer the opportunity to incorporate Les' Limited Edition Prints as part of the visual solution. 

### Front-Mounted Plexiglass

We creatively mount our images on single- or double-framed plexiglass for a clean, modern look that makes Les' images pop off the wall. Plexiglass adds exceptional depth to the image. As well, the plexiglass frames are mounted so they stand away from the wall for a three-dimensional effect. 

### Aluminum Prints

Aluminum prints are offered in brushed, glossy and matt finishes  to add a modern, sleek look to an installation. They are highly durable and can be mounted flat on a wall or with stand-offs to create a three-dimensional effect. 

### LED Backlit Panels

LED Backlit Panels offer the ultimate in trendy, arresting displays. A high graphic fabric is stretched over a frame and evenly backlit with LED lights to produce eye-popping images that visitors will not soon forget.

### Window/Glass Wall Treatments

We print our images on the highest quality backlit fabrics and synthetic materials, then apply them to glass walls or windows. The backlit effect allows the images to project their artful magic into the room. 

### Wall Coverings

Are you looking for exceptional visual pizzazz for large wall coverage? Then our specialized wall coverings are perfect. We print in our studio on the best quality wall covering vinyl from Intelicoat Technologies, the finest manufacturer in the United States. We then double coat each strip to achieve utmost durability. We can install images as long as your wall runs. The video (above) shows a recent thirty-foot wall that we covered with one of Les' purpose-shot images of Baltimore Harbor.
